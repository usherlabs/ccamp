# Cross-chain Asset Management Protocol - CCAMP

CCAMP is a general-purpose, modular, and custom data-driven Cross-chain Asset Management Protocol powered by:

- the Internet Computer for on-chain computation.
- the Log Store Network for highly-available and cryptographically pure event data.
- Web3 Functions (ie. Chainlink) for lean data relay.
